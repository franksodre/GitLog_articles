## Introduction

So, This week Microsoft turns 50 years old. It's been 5 decades that Microsoft stays around, always improving and contributing to the world. And that's why, today, as the first post in this "blog", we're going to talk about the 5 worst things Microsoft has done in 5 decades - 1 thing for each decade, as well as the 5 best things Microsoft has done in 5 decades. we won't talk about the success of a great company without talking about the failures, right?, does that make sense to you?

## 5 Worst Microsoft Products (One Per Decade)

Here are the five worst Microsoft products, one from each decade of the company's existence.

## Worst of the 1970s

1970s: Altair BASIC had significant limitations and bugs despite being Microsoft's first major product. While revolutionary, its early versions were prone to crashes and memory leaks that frustrated programmers.

## Worst of the 1980s

1980s: MS-DOS 4.0 was widely considered a disaster upon its 1988 release, with serious bugs that could corrupt hard drives, incompatibility issues, and performance problems that led many users to revert to MS-DOS 3.3.

## Worst of the 1990s

1990s: Microsoft Bob (1995) was a consumer-oriented interface designed to be more user-friendly but was universally panned for its childish design, system resource demands, and confusing interface. It became one of Microsoft's most notorious product failures.

## Worst of the 2000s

2000s: Windows Vista (2007) suffered from sluggish performance, driver compatibility issues, excessive hardware requirements, and intrusive security features. Many users and businesses skipped it entirely, waiting for Windows 7 instead.

## Worst of the 2010s

2010s: Windows 8 (2012) alienated users with its radical redesign that removed the Start menu and prioritized touch interfaces even on desktop computers. The confusing dual interfaces (traditional desktop and "Metro") created a jarring user experience that required Microsoft to backtrack with Windows 10.

## 5 Best Microsoft Products (One Per Decade)

Now let's look at the five best Microsoft products, highlighting one success from each decade.

## Best of the 1970s

1970s: Microsoft BASIC for microcomputers helped democratize programming and became the foundation for the personal computing revolution, making computers accessible to hobbyists and everyday users.

## Best of the 1980s

1980s: Microsoft Excel (first released for Mac in 1985, then Windows in 1987) revolutionized spreadsheet capabilities and eventually overtook the competition to become the industry standard for financial analysis and data organization.

## Best of the 1990s

1990s: Windows 95 transformed personal computing with its intuitive interface, improved multitasking, longer file names, and Plug and Play capabilities. It made computers significantly more accessible to everyday users and became a cultural phenomenon.

## Best of the 2000s

2000s: Xbox 360 (2005) established Microsoft as a major force in gaming with its powerful hardware, Xbox Live online service, and impressive game library. It sold over 84 million units and is considered one of the most influential gaming consoles ever released.

## Best of the 2010s

2010s: Microsoft Surface Pro line (beginning in 2013) successfully pioneered the 2-in-1 detachable laptop/tablet category. The Surface Pro 3 and later models found the right balance of performance and portability, influencing the entire PC industry to develop similar devices.

## Special thanks to Microsoft Majorana 1 chip

Microsoft's 50-year run isn't just about the past decades—it's about what's next, and the Majorana 1 chip, launched in February 2025, deserves its own spotlight. Too new to slot into our decade list, this quantum marvel taps into Majorana fermions—particles that double as their own antiparticles—to build topological qubits that promise insane stability and scale, potentially cramming a million into a chip you could hold. Cooked up from indium arsenide and aluminum nanowires, it's Microsoft's big swing at rewriting the future of computing, from cracking codes to curing diseases. It's not in stores yet, but it's too important to ignore—a special shout-out to where this 50-year-old giant might take us next.
