I think it all started during a **school annual project presentation**.  
It wasn’t anything special, as usual, but the one evaluating it was someone everyone at school said was one of the best.  
I wanted to be evaluated by him, because people have this need for **approval**, or something like that.  
Pretty annoying — I liked it better when there was less of that.

Anyway, that’s just context.  
The important part is that I didn’t leave with the grade I expected — or rather, the one others expected from me.  
A friend came up to me and said that the grades were already out.  
I, confident, thought I had done well, but he told me I got a **B**.  
At that moment, I was like, *“wait, a B is good, right? Or not?”*  
I looked at him, and he didn’t seem happy to say it.  
Adding the fact that he got a higher grade, I understood that a B wasn’t that great.

I exploded.  
I went to ask the students who were evaluating (since there weren’t enough teachers) what had happened.  
They hadn’t complained about my presentation, I had answered everything — I didn’t get it.  
They said that a **B** was the highest grade I could’ve gotten.

I complained to the teacher and blamed them, calling them **incompetent**.  
I really believed they weren’t capable of evaluating me.  
Today I regret that — and, at the same time, I don’t.

It was those words, and some conversations with friends who could see the other side of the story, that made me realize I was being **arrogant**.  
As I thought more about it, I realized I didn’t even know if a B was a good grade or not — maybe out of lack of sense, maybe because I assumed it was.

With all that, I realized I’m **nothing** — something I always told myself but had been forgetting.  
That happened because of the people around me and the decisions I made, like speaking more in public.  
People started to consider me **the best**, and some even competed with me.  
Those people eventually gave up, and now it feels like I have an answer for everything — and nothing.  
And I won’t lie: I also **fed** that behavior, that weird dependence.

I’ve always seen everyone as a **threat** — not in a bad way, but because anyone can grow, and brilliance can come from anywhere.  
Whenever I saw someone improving, I pushed myself several times harder to catch up.  
Today, with everyone settled, there’s no more competition — and I stopped trying too.  
I’ve always heard that we should compare ourselves only to who we were yesterday, but I’ve never been like that, and I don’t know when I’ll learn to be.

It’s sad to see the point I reached without realizing it.  
Until I solve this “**me today vs. me yesterday**” thing, I’ll need to stay close to **strong people**, get to know their abilities and limits — only then will I be able to surpass them.

Something important is that we **acquire behaviors** according to our environment.  
In my case, I now realize that most people around me have become **comfortable** with their abilities.  
In the first year, the same group just wanted to get better.  
Now it’s not like that anymore.  
I think it’s because of the absence of two people.  
For me, especially one of them — who, now I realize, was always the best among us.  
He probably felt the same way I do now, but to me, he was **motivation**.  
Too bad it wasn’t mutual.

One day, someone asked me if I wanted to be the **best of all**.  
I don’t remember what I said, but I know that day I didn’t have an answer.  
Today I can say it clearly: **no**.  
If I’m the best, how will I evolve?  
The feeling of **evolution** is one of the best there is.  
It’s the classic: *the journey is better than the destination* (I guess I think that way because I’m young).

Am I the best?  
**No.**  
Don’t get that into your head — and if you forget, just watch a bunch of **Satoru Gojo edits**.
