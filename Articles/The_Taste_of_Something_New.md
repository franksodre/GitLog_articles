Just yesterday, I decided to learn [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) to get
a feel for it. Not because I was  itching to try something new — if that were
the case, I’ve got a whole backlog:
[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)),
[Lua](https://www.lua.org/), [Go](https://go.dev/), [Java](https://dev.java/).
So why Ruby, of all things? Simple: [DHH](https://twitter.com/dhh), the Ruby on
Rails guy, got me curious.

I wanted to get a sense of Ruby’s syntax. Then I stumbled across a video of DHH
hyping up some new version of the framework. His excitement was totally
contagious; I could feel the enthusiasm through the screen. Oh, and he was
coding in [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) — that combo totally sold me.

As I explore Ruby’s syntax, I see it’s a bit more complex than
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)’s,  which
is the language I’ve been trying to step away from. But honestly, I  prefer it
that way. Having fewer tokens in a language makes it seem simple — or  even
*be* simple. That’s true for JavaScript, if you ignore those historical gaps
nobody understands, like:

```js 
NaN !== NaN // true 
```

JavaScript is very simple.

Besides DHH, I was really interested in the *Ruby way* of expressing ideas —
the  keywords, as far as I’ve been able to explore, are pretty friendly and
semantic.  I can see why some people compare them to pseudocode. Take for
example, printing  data — you use the `print` command, just like in
[Python](https://www.python.org/).

Obviously, my goal here isn’t to show you some kind of transition — or tell you
why you should, I don’t know, walk away from your current language — but to
share what it felt like to try something different.  I mean, unless you’re
someone deeply tied to — or rather, *locked into* — a  single language, it’s
actually a really, really good experience.

What I’ve learned with all this is that we're humans and fill our minds with
just one thing, whether because you think it's the best thing in the universe
or because it's trending now, **it's a huge mistake**. It might make you an
"expert" on it. But having different perspectives doesn't mean losing focus.
It can actually be a way to *unwind* — this is not just for programming.

It might sound like a lot coming from someone who only tried Ruby for a single
day, but trust me when I say this: **it’s real**, and you’ll realize it too —
if  you haven’t already.
