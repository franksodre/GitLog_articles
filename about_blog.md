description: Blog improvements and Retrospectives

I don't have too much to talk, this is a total random post but am here to say
that i changed somethings in the blog like you can see in the pictures and am
with this thinking of improvement i'd like to make the blog better without
losing his essence the changes were visual but i notice that my writtings at
this point what i've done, they don't reach pretty much anyone and obviously i
don't that.

## Write everyday

I'd like to write posts **everyday** but it can be really anything whether and new
thing tha am learn or things that happened to me. But you obvioulsy can notice
that those things are different from the idea of the blog that's way am gonna
bring categories to the blog that way people can easily read what is in their
interest, without hold myself back.
